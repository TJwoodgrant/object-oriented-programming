## Object Oriented Programming in other languages

Though we've only been using C# up until now, many of the concepts used in the creation of C# programs apply to other languages as well, such as Java, C++, and even Ruby. The concepts and the ability to design Object-Oriented (OO) Programs is not just limited to a single language, though oftentimes certain languages implement OO concepts differently.

This mini-report/article will highlight the differences in OO programming between a very strongly typed language, C#, with a dynamically typed language, Python. I have chosen Python not because of my familiarity with it--or rather, quite the opposite! I have not had a chance to dig into Python and hence, this article will be a learning experience for all those involved.

This article will presume the reader has intermediate knowledge of C# and OO Concepts.

### The Main Differences

|                           | C#                         | Python             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Compiled/Interpreted?** | Intermediate Language (IL) | Interpreted        |
| **Typing**                | Strongly Typed             | Dynamically Typed  |
| **Paradigms**             | OOP                        | OOP and Procedural |

#### Compilation vs. Interpretation

The general idea behind Compilation vs. Interpretation is the method in which the language is 'translated' into machine code. Compilation is when source code is converted directly into Machine Code through a compiler: a good example of this is C and compilers such as GCC. On the other hand, Interpreted languages are executed by the *Interpreter* and is not compiled into machine code but is executed directly; Python is often the quintessential example of interpreted languages.

C# is a bit unique in this regard, as it is compiled into an *Intermediate Language (IL)*. Without going into too much detail, it can be considered the halfway-point between compilation and interpretation. Often, compilation takes time to 'compile' but runs faster, whereas interpretation does not require time to compile but runs slower. C#'s use of IL implies that it still runs 'fast', however, it does not require complete compilation into machine code.

#### Typing

Not in the traditional sense (keyboard-typing), typing refers to how strongly *types* are adhered to in a programming language. Consider the following:
