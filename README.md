### For High Distinction

A High Distinction (HD) (Grade Point of 4 out of 4 or 7 out of 7), a student must demonstrate a very strong understanding of the core Object-Oriented (OO) Principles, notably Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Inheritance. Furthermore, a student must demonstrate extensive knowledge of the OO design paradigm ranging from not but restricted to: good programming practice, appropriate application of OO principles, appropriate information hiding and encapsulation, effective modular design and the use of known class-libraries such as the university's [SwinGame](swingame.com) library.

Of course, that all isn't enough for a HD. A HD (and to a lesser extent but still inclusive of a Distinction), students are required to undertake a custom program of their choosing. Note that the keywords are *Distinction **Program*** and *High Distinction **Project***, whereby the student is judged based on the complexity and extent in which they have both understood and extended out of the unit, OO programming and principles. Note that this does not include program complexity, such that it does not unfairly advantage those who have existing. possibly out-of-scope computer science projects. This project is strictly concerned with OO programming and therefore, focus is put on the design and the communication of the design through [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) and appropriate UML (Class, Sequence) Diagrams.

### Artillery 3

My personal HD Project was the Artillery3 Custom Project, which includes the Artillery3 game with the project aspect being the Fractal Terrain Generation (*Recursive Displacement Algorithm*, Fourier et al. 1982) and the extensive use of design patterns, along with the sheer scope of the program. 

More information and the source code can be found at the [Artillery3 Repository](https://github.com/Mikanwolfe/Artillery3). For a more casual and laid-out explanation, head to [nekox.net](https://nekox.net) for more information on anything related to Robotics Engineering and Computer Science, presumably not much about cats.

* * n.b. As of writing, nekox.net requires significant rewrites across the board -- I will dedicate more time to this in the coming weeks, but to be sure, give it a glance over.

#### A Note on this Repository

Yes, this repository contains all the "answers" to OOP. No, I won't help nor respond to any requests for help. If you're studying at a University, check out all the resources available to you. If you're from Swin-U in particular, check out ATC620: the Programming Help Desk; make sure you go at odd times (think 4/5pm) for the best help.

A friendly reminder that plagiarism is a thing, even with programming. Feel free to have a look if you're stuck, but if you don't understand it, you're doing it wrong. I don't want to pull this repository simply because one person did something silly; I stand by the idea that all information should be readily accessible, though some more than others.
