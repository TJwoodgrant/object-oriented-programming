# Object Oriented Concepts

---

### Scaffolding

**Format**: Tutorial/Half-Comic. Think CSP Tutorials.

**Creativity:** 

* Let's work on a hybrid comic but with more text and graphics instead.
* Should keep drawings fairly simple for this, with more diagrams and very minimal code.

#### Programming Artefacts

###### Object

- Describe a component with properties and methods
- Are designed to resemble real world objects
- describe what they can do and hide information the outside world doesn't need to know
  - describes what the thing is capable of

###### Method

* functions and procedures defined within an object that can do something useful
* can modify the data fields of the object
* allow objects to interact with one anotherobj

###### Fields

* attributes or properties
* declared in classes and are members of a class. they can be private and properties can be public to expose certain information. a form of de-coupling.

###### Class

* Classes are blueprints for creating objects
* Provide initial values for state
* implementations of behaviour (member functions or methods)
* Set of instructions to build a specific type of object
* create instances of objects
* think about classes and instantiation as like baking a cake
* class is like a recipe for a cake, the recipe is not a cake.
* following the recipe is instantiating it
* bake as many as you like, reference variables help keep track of them

###### Interface

* interfaces are essentially contracts that enforce certain properties on ab object.
* they are also known as contracts and may be thought of with a "is also a" relationship. For example, a submarine is a "submarine" but "is also a" boat. 
* They are purely abstract and define the functions that a class must implement-- that is, they must have, to qualify as that sort of interface.
* Sub-ma-boat. Sub-ma-car?

#### Concepts and Principles

###### Abstraction

* handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
* treat these sorts of things as black boxes because the user simply doesn't need to know about it
* enables the user to create more complex devices using the current abstractions without worrying about the hidden complexity.
* Making coffee is a well-known abstraction where instead of grinding the beans (etc), you can just press a button and the coffee machine does it for you
  * Example i can implement is terrain generation and the terrain factory.

###### Encapsulation

* It is the idea of keeping data and methods in one place (i.e. a class).
* Hides internal details of the object from the outside world (i.e. information hiding)
* Getters and setters are good examples of encapsulation as it holds the private values private and allows access to them only through the methods. 
* Also describes the access modifiers. In general, they are:
  * Private,
    * Only used within the class. Subclasses cannot access.
  * No modifier,
  * Protected,
    * Similar to private, however, can be accessed and overridden by subclasses.
  * Public.
    * Accessed by current class and all other classes (think being on the shell of the capsule).

###### Inheritance

* the way one class acquires the properties, fields, and methods, from a "parent" class. 
* Allows us to re-use fields and methods from the existing class and expanding on them
* Allows for code reusability and compatibility and is a very important concept.
* Also contains the idea of generalisation to specialisation
* Allows classes to be treated as parent classes (student as human, lecturer as human) when a general object is needed
* Has a "is-a" relationship (student "is a" human)
* Allows common things to share common methods/properties/traits.
  * e.g. all cars can drive, not all can have 4x4.

###### Polymorphism

* Meaning "Many forms", polymorphism is that idea that different objects can be treated as another one. 

* > Allows classes to be treated as parent classes (student as human, lecturer as human) when a general object is needed 

* Also present in method overloading, which allows multiple methods to be called under the same name, but with different signatures to aid in code reuse.



##### Responsibility Driven Design

Responsibility Driven Design is used to explore and appropriately design OOP programs. 

###### Roles

* Describes the purpose *role* that needs to be fulfilled within a particular program. 
* In turn, the roles will describe the responsibilities of that object class.
* The process involves:
  * Finding objects and defining roles
  * identifying responsibilities and allocating them to roles
  * Planning collaborations
* Roles are useful for identification as they can provide a glimpse into the amount of generalisation and specialisation of any specific role by identifying common components or formats

###### Responsibilities

* They are related to an object being able to do something or know something. What does it need to do? What does it need to know?
* Each class should have only one responsibility (responsibility-driven design)
* Responsibilities must know something (fields), and if it known publicly, it can be a done with a property or accessor method.
* If a responsibility must do something, it can be implemented as a private method to simplify the internals or a public method for manipulation or implementation of an api or interface.

###### Collaborations

* The idea that objects have to communicate with one another
* Defined as three categories:
  * Dependency
    * Thought of as a "uses" relationship and represents and temporary one between roles in one one role uses objects of another role
    * UML diagrams: represented by dashed arrow that points to the class that is used.
  * Association
    * A permanent relationship: the object knows the objects it is associated with and can be thought of as a "has-a" relationship.
    * There are three types of association:
      * Association
        * Permanent relationship between two roles
      * Aggregation
        * A whole is made of parts, but the parts can be shared with other objects
      * Composite Aggregation
        * A whole is the sum of it's parts, and therefore the lifetime of it's parts is the lifetime of the whole.
      * UML Diagrams:
        * Association: Solid line, no arrowheads
        * Aggregation: Solid line with hollow diamond on the whole side
        * Composite: Solid line with solid diamond on the whole side.
  * Inheritance
    * Can be thought of as "is-a kind of" relationship: rectangles and ellipses are shapes but humans are presumably not shapes.

###### Coupling

* Measure of how much something (classes, methods) relies on other modules. Generally try to reduce coupling or reduce the amount a given model relies on other modules of a system
  * Loose
    * members should be anonymous to each other and only communicate through a well-defined protocol. Any one of you can be replaced.
  * Tight
    * You and your passwords.

###### Cohesion

* Measure of how closely related members (classes, methods, functionality) of a module are to the other members of the same module. Generally desirable to increase cohesion as it increases specification of that task.
  * Low
    * Convenience store, has everything from gas to milk to ATMs. Things have little on common and it's super-convenient but it also means that there's an offset to increased cost and reduced quality.
  * High
    * The cheese store. They sell cheese. Nothing else. Can't beat 'em when it comes to cheese though.
