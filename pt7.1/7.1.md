**Audience: **

**Task:** Explain the principles of OOP as you understand them and outline what qualities you should look for in good OO programs. Relate these to programs that you've written in this unit.

Let's do a preliminary article to make this rather simple. 



### Object Oriented Programming

Of the many paradigms (read: ways) of programming, Object-Oriented (OO) is amongst the most popular and useful. Object-Oriented programming, as the name implies, is centred around the idea of treating code as objects and data instead of the traditional 'grocery-list' form of procedural programming,

Moving away from the grocery-list programming that's characteristic of procedural programming, Object Oriented Programming treats programs as being comprised of objects instead of step-by-step instructions such as procedures and functions.

This, in a sense, is a bit more intuitive and scalable when it comes to larger programs as not only does OO-programming conform to the idea of using objects within code, but also certain rules and ideals to strive such as high cohesion or low coupling designs.

#### Characteristics of OO

Though different languages have slight variations in their implementation and handling of OO principles, they share a large number of common features:

1. Software is divided into "objects" which generally comprise of methods (think functions) and data
2. Data can be hidden such that it is only visible to itself or similar objects, or it can be 'publicly' available to other objects
3. Objects interact with other objects

Often the concept of objects is straightforward, however, thinking of OO programming strictly in real-world terms isn't always the best idea, a flaw that will be explained later on.

### Objects, Data and Methods

Objects are organised into two distinct but strongly connected sections: Data, and Methods. 

#### Data

From the familiar integers and characters, local variables within functions are reminiscent of the data seen in Objects. Objects, like the real-world equivalents, often contain information about itself: a human has a name, a projectile has a velocity, and hackers have vulnerabilities. 

Breaking this information down into data types such as strings, numbers, or enumerations is the *data* stored, accessed, and manipulated by, objects. 

Data that is accessed from the outside (such as asking for an object's name) is known as a **property**, whether read-only or fully accessible, they are distinct from the data itself. The properties of an object are the *getters and setters* that act as a middleman to protect information from the outside world.

#### Methods

Akin to the procedures and functions of the more procedural programming, object methods are functions declared by an object (and consequently *encapsulated* by it) that allows an object to *do stuff*. A good example of this is telling an object to draw itself in a game--in Artillery 3, as different objects have different ways of drawing themselves and different sprites, all objects that need to be drawn have their own draw function, like characters or the terrain.

When the game is drawn, the game just calls upon all entities to draw themselves.

### Concepts of OO Programming

There are many concepts within Object-Oriented programming that enforce a strong programming paradigm as it provides a relatively straightforward way to organise information and data and provides the framework for us squishy humans to think about OO programming.

#### Classes

*Classes* are something of a difficult-to-initially grasp concept as there are many definitions for them and many ways to think about them, though half the time it's due to the silly name *class.* A class is composed of two "components of understanding":

1. Classes are blueprints. They are used to make (*instantiate*) objects.
2. Objects of the same class are the same *Class* of object but they are separate objects.

Less like classes of students and more like classes of warships, two cups of coffee from the *cappuccino* class share the same make... and model... --No, let's take the warships example.

A certain number of years ago there existed a really big chunck of steel floating on the ocean known as the **Queen Elizabeth-class** battleship. Of the **Queen Elizabeth-class** battleships were two famous ships: **HMS Warspite** and **HMS Queen Elizabeth**. 

We can say that HMS Warspite and HMS Queen Elizabeth are members of the Queen Elizabeth-Class of battleships. 

* Warspite and Queen Elizabeth are objects of the Queen Elizabeth Class
* Warspite and Queen Elizabeth are different ships of the same model: they have the same calibre of guns, armour, layout, but they are not the same object. The guns of Warspite exist in the Warspite object.
* Warspite and Queen Elizabeth have slightly different information that they hold: they have different names, and different naval personnel on board, however, they **both** have a name and (roughly) the same number of personnel on board.
  * Think that the *type* of data is the same (string, people) but the contents are different.

An important concept to understand is that **there is no real battleship that *is* the Queen Elizabeth-Class**. The class of battleship is not a tangible thing: it represents the class of ships that exist but the pure class itself is just an idea; the pure class is a blueprint that is used to make the ships.

##### Classes and Objects

The *Akatsuki-Class* of destroyers represent four distinct warships: *Akatsuki, Hibiki, Ikazuchi, Inazuma*. 

* They all contain information, such as armour, guns, and names.
  * Each ship has her own name, her own set of weapons, and her own steel that make armour.
* They all do similar things, such as move, shoot, or even signal other ships.
  * They each don't have to design their own way of steering or propulsion, it's all defined within the *Akatsuki-Class'* blueprints.

This brings us to more the more intriguing OO concepts.

#### Abstraction

The concept of abstraction is a somewhat vague one as the definition varies based on the specification. In the end, abstraction for OO programming refers to being able to treat objects as block boxes--only caring about the inputs and outputs and not worrying about how the internals work.

An example of this from the warship example is the 

#### Encapsulation

#### Inheritance

#### Polymorphism

#### Coupling and Cohesion



### Responsibility Driven Design







### Design patterns

#### GoF Design Patterns

#### Concept of Composition

##### Singleton

##### Command

##### Composite

Why the warship example? That's because everything described is present in Artillery 3.

#### Programming Artefacts

###### Object

- Describe a component with properties and methods
- Are designed to resemble real world objects
- describe what they can do and hide information the outside world doesn't need to know
  - describes what the thing is capable of

###### Method

* functions and procedures defined within an object that can do something useful
* can modify the data fields of the object
* allow objects to interact with one anotherobj

###### Fields

* attributes or properties
* declared in classes and are members of a class. they can be private and properties can be public to expose certain information. a form of de-coupling.

###### Class

* Classes are blueprints for creating objects
* Provide initial values for state
* implementations of behaviour (member functions or methods)
* Set of instructions to build a specific type of object
* create instances of objects
* think about classes and instantiation as like baking a cake
* class is like a recipe for a cake, the recipe is not a cake.
* following the recipe is instantiating it
* bake as many as you like, reference variables help keep track of them

###### Interface

* interfaces are essentially contracts that enforce certain properties on ab object.
* they are also known as contracts and may be thought of with a "is also a" relationship. For example, a submarine is a "submarine" but "is also a" boat. 
* They are purely abstract and define the functions that a class must implement-- that is, they must have, to qualify as that sort of interface.
* Sub-ma-boat. Sub-ma-car?

#### Concepts and Principles

###### Abstraction

* handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user
* treat these sorts of things as black boxes because the user simply doesn't need to know about it
* enables the user to create more complex devices using the current abstractions without worrying about the hidden complexity.
* Making coffee is a well-known abstraction where instead of grinding the beans (etc), you can just press a button and the coffee machine does it for you
  * Example i can implement is terrain generation and the terrain factory.

###### Encapsulation

* It is the idea of keeping data and methods in one place (i.e. a class).
* Hides internal details of the object from the outside world (i.e. information hiding)
* Getters and setters are good examples of encapsulation as it holds the private values private and allows access to them only through the methods. 
* Also describes the access modifiers. In general, they are:
  * Private,
    * Only used within the class. Subclasses cannot access.
  * No modifier,
  * Protected,
    * Similar to private, however, can be accessed and overridden by subclasses.
  * Public.
    * Accessed by current class and all other classes (think being on the shell of the capsule).

###### Inheritance

* the way one class acquires the properties, fields, and methods, from a "parent" class. 
* Allows us to re-use fields and methods from the existing class and expanding on them
* Allows for code reusability and compatibility and is a very important concept.
* Also contains the idea of generalisation to specialisation
* Allows classes to be treated as parent classes (student as human, lecturer as human) when a general object is needed
* Has a "is-a" relationship (student "is a" human)
* Allows common things to share common methods/properties/traits.
  * e.g. all cars can drive, not all can have 4x4.

###### Polymorphism

* Meaning "Many forms", polymorphism is that idea that different objects can be treated as another one. 

* > Allows classes to be treated as parent classes (student as human, lecturer as human) when a general object is needed 

* Also present in method overloading, which allows multiple methods to be called under the same name, but with different signatures to aid in code reuse.



##### Responsibility Driven Design (Design Concepts)

Responsibility Driven Design is used to explore and appropriately design OOP programs. 

###### Roles

* Describes the purpose *role* that needs to be fulfilled within a particular program. 
* In turn, the roles will describe the responsibilities of that object class.
* The process involves:
  * Finding objects and defining roles
  * identifying responsibilities and allocating them to roles
  * Planning collaborations
* Roles are useful for identification as they can provide a glimpse into the amount of generalisation and specialisation of any specific role by identifying common components or formats

###### Responsibilities

* They are related to an object being able to do something or know something. What does it need to do? What does it need to know?
* Each class should have only one responsibility (responsibility-driven design)
* Responsibilities must know something (fields), and if it known publicly, it can be a done with a property or accessor method.
* If a responsibility must do something, it can be implemented as a private method to simplify the internals or a public method for manipulation or implementation of an api or interface.

###### Collaborations

* The idea that objects have to communicate with one another
* Defined as three categories:
  * Dependency
    * Thought of as a "uses" relationship and represents and temporary one between roles in one one role uses objects of another role
    * UML diagrams: represented by dashed arrow that points to the class that is used.
  * Association
    * A permanent relationship: the object knows the objects it is associated with and can be thought of as a "has-a" relationship.
    * There are three types of association:
      * Association
        * Permanent relationship between two roles
      * Aggregation
        * A whole is made of parts, but the parts can be shared with other objects
      * Composite Aggregation
        * A whole is the sum of it's parts, and therefore the lifetime of it's parts is the lifetime of the whole.
      * UML Diagrams:
        * Association: Solid line, no arrowheads
        * Aggregation: Solid line with hollow diamond on the whole side
        * Composite: Solid line with solid diamond on the whole side.
  * Inheritance
    * Can be thought of as "is-a kind of" relationship: rectangles and ellipses are shapes but humans are presumably not shapes.

###### Coupling

* Measure of how much something (classes, methods) relies on other modules. Generally try to reduce coupling or reduce the amount a given model relies on other modules of a system
* *Level of dependency* -- Minimise coupling and maximise 
  * Loose
    * members should be anonymous to each other and only communicate through a well-defined protocol. Any one of you can be replaced.
  * Tight
    * You and your passwords.

###### Cohesion

* Measure of how closely related members (classes, methods, functionality) of a module are to the other members of the same module. Generally desirable to increase cohesion as it increases specification of that task.
* How it makes sense (if the methods and private fields really specific to that class?) Can't put it into other classes (player has name and description specific to that class.) 
* *Specification* (A cohesive class)
  * Low
    * Convenience store, has everything from gas to milk to ATMs. Things have little on common and it's super-convenient but it also means that there's an offset to increased cost and reduced quality.
  * High
    * The cheese store. They sell cheese. Nothing else. Can't beat 'em when it comes to cheese though.
