**How many Counter objects were created?**

* 2

**What is the relationship between the variables and the objects?**

* Objects contain information. In this case, the *name* of the object piece of private information held by the object.

**Where are the objects allocated? The stack or the heap?**

* Objects are allocated within the **heap**, more primitive data types (e.g. int), are allocated in the stack.

**How does a class' *new* method affect memory? What does it do and what does it return?**

* The `new` method allocates memory to an object. Specifically, it calls the constructor for an object and hence, returns either a reference or the object itself.

**Draw a diagram showing the locations of the variables and objects in main**

* What sort of diagram?
